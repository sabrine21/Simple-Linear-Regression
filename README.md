# Home Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression
This project aims to predict the sale price of homes using Simple Linear Regression. 
The dataset used for this project includes information such as the area of the home and the corresponding price.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found in the file home_prices.csv. The dataset includes the following columns:

area: The size of the home in square feet.
price: The price if the home.

# Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

# Usage
To run this project, simply run the home_price_prediction.py script. 
This script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, and fit a Simple Linear Regression model to predict the sale price of homes. 
The predicted sale prices will be saved in a new CSV file called prediction.csv.

# Results
The results of this project can be found in the file prediction.csv. This file includes the predicted sale price for each home in the dataset 
based on the Simple Linear Regression model.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Simple Linear Regression to predict the sale price of homes. 
While this model may not be the most accurate for predicting home prices, it provides a good starting point for further analysis 
and exploration of more complex models.
